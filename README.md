# ADVENTURE-LOG

## Overview

Adventure-Log is a web app created to track generic stats, and take notes for TTRPG sessions.
Currently it allows the user to test the site with pre-made characters, or create their own via form input if they
choose to. Unfortunately there is not a way to save character information between sessions right now. But I am working
to implement that, along with some other features.
