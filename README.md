# ADVENTURE-LOG

## Overview

Adventure-Log is a web app created to track generic stats, and take notes for TTRPG sessions.
Currently it allows the users to input custom resources (health points, spell slots, etc.) that they
want to keep track of during their game sessions. They can upload or download these trackers as json data to use them
between sessions.
